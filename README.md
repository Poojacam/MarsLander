# MarsLander

1. Simulated the flight of a Mars lander in multiple starting scenarios using C++
2. Implemented Euler and Verlet integrators to calculate trajectory of spacecraft and then merged the code
with the supplied graphical visualization functions.
3. Utilised control theory to program an autopilot function that led to the lander autonomously landing.

I wrote the code in Lander.cpp
Lander.h and Lander.graphics were supplied code.
